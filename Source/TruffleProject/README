CURRENT STATE

Apr 12, 2016
There are contracts files for part of the system (Base Contracts D in the diagram) with some skeleton code in the "contracts" forlder of the Truffle instance. No JS code to use them and no Front-End.

Apr 16, 2016
There are base contracts (D in the diagram) and test case contracts, which use the system (Math.sol, MathAddAction.sol). 

TODO

1. A better systems for making “Calls” to contracts registered with Doug: Action.sol, ActionsManager.sol method execute, Math.sol method add.
2. Use Grove DB lib in ActionsDB.sol and DougDB.sol. Data structures for actions and contracts. Also DS for list for DougDB._getAll().
3. Implementation for Doug.switchDoug() (depends on 1.). 
4. Just model the use of a permissions system without implementation.
5. Updated solidity syntaxes where possible, ie possible usage of (new contract)() , self destruct, libraries etc..
