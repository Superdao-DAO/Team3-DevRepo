CURRENT STATE

There are contracts files for part of the system (Base Contracts D in the diagram) with some skeleton code in the "contracts" forlder of the Truffle instance. No JS code to use them and no Front-End.

TODO

1. Use modifiers for conditional access. For example isCalledFrom, isCalledFromDoug.
2. Updated solidity syntaxes where possible, ie possible usage of (new contract)() , self destruct, libraries etc..
3. A better systems for making “Calls” to contracts registered with Doug through the action manger.
4. Assume that you have grove library as storage
5. Just model the use of a permissions system without implementation.
